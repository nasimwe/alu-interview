Rain Water Retention Function 

This Python module, rain.py, contains a function rain(walls) designed to calculate the total volume of water trapped between walls after rainfall.

The function takes a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls as input. It iterates through the list, computing the trapped water between each wall based on the heights of adjacent walls. 

The algorithm excludes the ends of the list, assuming they are not walls. If the list is empty, the function returns 0. The calculated total trapped water is returned as an integer. Ensure to follow the provided docstrings for usage guidance and input/output specifications.
